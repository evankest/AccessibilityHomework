# AccessibilityHomework
1st homework
<<<<<<< HEAD
This is my first README.  The process I used to clean up the code for the Accessibilty Homework was to analyze the HTML structure from the beginning  and look for ways to organize it into easier to understand sections.  I also added necessary tags to improve the flow and make the code easier to read. 
One of the biggest problems with the original code is the sloppy use of dividions
=======
This project was meant to help us understand that the structure of the code has an affect on how code readers assess meaning in the code.  It also makes the code easier to edit and correct or change in the future.
